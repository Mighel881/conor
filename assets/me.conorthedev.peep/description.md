peep is a tweak that allows you to temporarily hide your status bar by tapping on it. It only works on the homescreen and lockscreen at the moment.

The settings instantly apply *without* the need to respring your device! 

Current preference options:
- Enable / Disable
- Use Animations

**Notes:**
- peep is [open source](https://github.com/cbyrne/peep), be sure to check out the code if you're interested.
